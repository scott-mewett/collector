# Minimum Requirements

## Introduction
This document provides information related to the minimum requirements for running RealTheory with your cluster.

## Kubernetes Version
The RealTheory collector is currently supported on the following versions of Kubernetes:

- 1.31
- 1.30
- 1.29

## How do I check my cluster's Kubernetes version?
The simplest way of checking your clusterâ€™s Kubernetes version is to use the kubectl version command. This command will output information for the kubectl cluster and the Kubernetes client.

```sh
kubectl version
```

Output
```
Client Version: v1.30.2
Server Version: v1.30.4
```

The Server Version is the cluster's Kubernetes version.
